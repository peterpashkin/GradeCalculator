# GradeCalculator

I worked on this project during highschool.
It calculates your final grade based on the pretty complex german system for it.
It has a user registration with a connection to a MySQL database via PHP.
Most of the project is PHP,HTML and CSS with some SQL.
This was my first ever software project, so the code is rather bad, it is supposed to be a rather funny memory.
